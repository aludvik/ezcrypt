# Chapter 1

The goals of this project are:

1. To *not* implement any cryptographic algorithms, protocols, primitives and
   instead build on top of existing, proven, open source projects.
2. To provide a secure, high-level cryptography library with a simple API.
3. To provide similar bindings in all popular languages.
4. To provide cross-platform support.
